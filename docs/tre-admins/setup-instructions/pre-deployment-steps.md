# Pre-deployment steps

!!! info
    See [Environment variables](../environment-variables.md) for full details of the deployment related variables.

## Set environment configuration variables of shared management resources

1. Open the `/devops/.env.sample` file and then save it without the .sample extension. You should now have a file called `.env` located in the `/devops` folder. The file contains configuration variables for the shared management infrastructure which is used to support the deployment of one or more Azure TRE instances.

2. Provide the values for the following variables:

  | Variable | Description |
  | -------- | ----------- |
  | `LOCATION` | The [Azure location (region)](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/geographies/#geographies) for all resources. E.g., `westeurope` |
  | `MGMT_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME` | The shared resource group for all management resources, including the storage account. |
  | `MGMT_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME` | The name of the storage account to hold the Terraform state and other deployment artifacts. |
  | `ACR_NAME` | A globally unique name for the [Azure Container Registry (ACR)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/container-registry/) that will be created to store deployment images. |
  | `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` | The Azure subscription ID for all resources. |

  !!! tip
      To retrieve your Azure subscription ID, use the `az` command line interface available in the development container. In the terminal window in Visual Studio Code, type `az login` followed by `az account show` to see your default subscription. Please refer to `az account -help` for further details on how to change your active subscription.

The rest of the variables can have their default values. You should now have a `.env` file that looks similar to the one below:

```plaintext
# Management infrastructure
LOCATION=westeurope
MGMT_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME=aztremgmt
MGMT_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME=aztremgmt
TERRAFORM_STATE_CONTAINER_NAME=tfstate
ACR_NAME=aztreacr

ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=12...54e

# If you want to override the currently signed in credentials
# ARM_TENANT_ID=__CHANGE_ME__
# ARM_CLIENT_ID=__CHANGE_ME__
# ARM_CLIENT_SECRET=__CHANGE_ME__

# Debug mode
DEBUG="false"
```

## Set environment configuration variables of the Azure TRE instance

Next, you will set the configuration variables for the specific Azure TRE instance:

1. Use the terminal window in Visual Studio Code to execute the following script from within the development container:

   ```bash
   az login
   ```

  !!! note
      In case you have several subscriptions and would like to change your default subscription use `az account set --subscription <desired subscription ID>`

1. Open the `/templates/core/.env.sample` file and then save it without the .sample extension. You should now have a file called `.env` located in the `/templates/core` folder.
1. Set the first one of the variables, `TRE_ID`, which is the alphanumeric, with underscores and hyphens allowed, ID for the Azure TRE instance. The value will be used in various Azure resources, and **needs to be globally unique and less than 12 characters in length**. Use only lowercase letters. Choose wisely!
1. Choose whether or not to deploy the built-in web UI (`./ui`). By default this will _not_ be deployed. To deploy the UI, ensure you set `DEPLOY_UI=true` in the .env file.
1. Run `make auth` script to create 4 different AAD Applications that are used for TRE. The details of the script are covered in the [auth document](../auth.md).

  !!! note
      The full functionality of the script requires directory admin privileges. You may need to contact your friendly Azure Active Directory admin to complete this step. The app registrations can be created manually in Azure Portal too. For more information, see [Authentication and authorization](../auth.md).
  
  With the output of the script, you can now provide the required auth related values for the following variables in the `/templates/core/.env` configuration file:

  | Variable | Description |
  | -------- | ----------- |
  | `AAD_TENANT_ID` | The Azure AD Tenant ID. |
  | `API_CLIENT_ID` | API application (client) ID. |
  | `API_CLIENT_SECRET` | API application client secret. |
  | `SWAGGER_UI_CLIENT_ID` | Swagger (OpenAPI) UI application (client) ID. |
  | `TEST_ACCOUNT_CLIENT_ID`| If you supplied `--automation-account` in the above command, this is the user that will run the tests for you |
  | `TEST_ACCOUNT_CLIENT_SECRET` | If you supplied `--automation-account` in the above command, this is the password of the user that will run the tests for you. |
  | `WORKSPACE_API_CLIENT_ID` | Each workspace is secured behind it's own AD Application|
  | `WORKSPACE_API_CLIENT_SECRET` | Each workspace is secured behind it's own AD Application. This is the secret for that application.|

All other variables can have their default values for now. You should now have a `.env` file that looks similar to below:

```plaintext
# Used for TRE deployment
TRE_ID=mytre
TRE_URL="https://${TRE_ID}.westurope.cloudapp.azure.com"
CORE_ADDRESS_SPACE="10.1.0.0/22"
TRE_ADDRESS_SPACE="10.0.0.0/12"
DEPLOY_GITEA=true
DEPLOY_NEXUS=true
RESOURCE_PROCESSOR_TYPE="vmss_porter"

# Auth configuration
AAD_TENANT_ID=72e...45
API_CLIENT_ID=af6...dc
API_CLIENT_SECRET=abc...12
SWAGGER_UI_CLIENT_ID=d87...12

TEST_ACCOUNT_CLIENT_ID=4e...40
TEST_ACCOUNT_CLIENT_SECRET=sp...7c

WORKSPACE_API_CLIENT_ID=3e...40
WORKSPACE_API_CLIENT_SECRET=rp...7c

```

## Add admin user

Make sure the **TRE Administrators** and **TRE Users** roles, defined by the API app registration, are assigned to your user and others as required. See [Enabling users](../auth.md#enabling-users) for instructions.
