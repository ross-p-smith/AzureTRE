# GitHub Actions workflows (CI/CD)

To deploy the Azure TRE using GitHub workflows, create a fork of the repository.

Deployment is done using the `/.github/workflows/deploy_tre.yml` workflow. This method is also used to deploy the dev/test environment for the original Azure TRE repository.

## Setup instructions

Before you can run the `deploy_tre.yml` pipeline there are some one-time configuration steps that we need to do, similar to the Pre-deployment steps for manual deployment.

!!! tip
    In some of the steps below, you are asked to configure repository secrets. Follow the [GitHub guide](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) on creating repository secrets if you are unfamiliar with this step.

1. Create a service principal for the subscription so that the workflow can provision Azure resources.
1. Decide on a TRE ID and the location for the Azure resources
1. Create app registrations for API authentication
1. Create app registrations and a user for the E2E tests
1. Create a workspace app registration for setting up workspaces (for the E2E tests)
1. Create a Teams WebHook for deployment notifications
1. Configure repository secrets
1. Deploy the TRE using the workflow

### Create a service principal for provisioning resources

1. Login to Azure

  Log in to Azure using `az login` and select the Azure subscription you wish to deploy Azure TRE to:

  ```cmd
  az login
  az account list
  az account set --subscription <subscription ID>
  ```

  !!! caution
      When running locally the credentials of the logged-in user will be used to deploy the infrastructure. Hence, it is essential that the user has enough permissions to deploy all resources.

  See [Sign in with Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli) for more details.

1. Create a service principal

  A service principal needs to be created to authorize CI/CD workflows to provision resources for the TRE workspaces and workspace services.

  Create a main service principal with "**Owner**" role:

  ```cmd
  az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "sp-aztre-core" --role Owner --scopes /subscriptions/<subscription_id> --sdk-auth
  ```

  !!! caution
      Save the JSON output locally - as you will need it later for setting secrets in the build

1. Configure the repository secrets. These values will be in the JSON file from the previous step.

  | <div style="width: 230px">Secret name</div> | Description |
  | ----------- | ----------- |
  | `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` | The Azure subscription to deploy to  |
  | `ARM_TENANT_ID` | The Azure tenant to deploy to  |
  | `ARM_CLIENT_ID` | The Azure Client Id (user)  |
  | `ARM_CLIENT_SECRET` | The Azure Client Secret (password)  |

### Decide on a TRE ID and Azure resources location

Configure the TRE ID and LOCATION repository secrets

| <div style="width: 230px">Secret name</div> | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `TRE_ID` | A globally unique identifier. `TRE_ID` can be found in the resource names of the Azure TRE instance; for example, a `TRE_ID` of `tre-dev-42` will result in a resource group name for Azure TRE instance of `rg-tre-dev-42`. This must be less than 12 characters. Allowed characters: Alphanumeric, underscores, and hyphens. |
| `LOCATION` | The Azure location (region) for all resources. E.g. `westeurope` |

### Create app registrations for API authentication

Follow the instructions to run the **app registration script** in the [Authentication and Authorization document](../auth.md#app-registrations). Use the values for TRE ID and LOCATION from above.

Configure the TRE API and Swagger UI repository secrets

| <div style="width: 230px">Secret name</div> | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `AAD_TENANT_ID` | The tenant ID of the Azure AD. |
| `SWAGGER_UI_CLIENT_ID` | The application (client) ID of the TRE Swagger UI app. |
| `API_CLIENT_ID` | The application (client) ID of the TRE API app. |
| `API_CLIENT_SECRET` | The application password (client secret) of the TRE API app. |

### Create an app registration and a user for the E2E tests

Follow the instructions to [create an app registration and a test user for the E2E tests in the Authentication and Authorization](../auth.md#tre-e2e-test) document.

Configure the E2E Test repository secrets

| <div style="width: 230px">Secret name</div> | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `TEST_APP_ID` | The application (client) ID of the E2E Test app |
| `TEST_USER_NAME` | The username of the E2E Test User |
| `TEST_USER_PASSWORD` | The password of the E2E Test User |

### Create a workspace app registration for setting up workspaces (for the E2E tests)

Follow the [instructions to create a workspace app registration](../auth.md#workspaces) (used for the E2E tests) - and make the E2E test user a **WorkspaceOwner** for the app registration.

Configure the TEST_WORKSPACE_APP_ID repository secret

| <div style="width: 230px">Secret name</div> | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `TEST_WORKSPACE_APP_ID` | The application (client) ID of the Workspaces app. |
| `TEST_WORKSPACE_APP_SECRET` | The application (client) secret of the Workspaces app. |

### Create a Teams Webhook for deployment notifications

The `deploy_tre.yml` workflow sends a notification to a Microsoft Teams channel when it finishes running.

!!! note
    If you don't want to notify a channel, you can also remove the **Notify dedicated teams channel** steps in the pipeline

1. Follow the [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook) to create a webhook for your channel

1. Configure the MS_TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URI repository secret

  | <div style="width: 230px">Secret name</div> | Description |
  | ----------- | ----------- |
  | `MS_TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URI` | URI for the Teams channel webhook |

### Configure repository secrets

Configure additional repository secrets used in the deployment pipeline

| <div style="width: 230px">Secret name</div> | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `MGMT_RESOURCE_GROUP` | The name of the shared resource group for all Azure TRE core resources. |
| `STATE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME` | The name of the storage account to hold the Terraform state and other deployment artifacts. E.g. `mystorageaccount`. |
| `TF_STATE_CONTAINER` | The name of the blob container to hold the Terraform state. By convention the value is `tfstate`. |
| `ACR_NAME` | A globally unique name for the Azure Container Registry (ACR) that will be created to store deployment images. |
| `CORE_ADDRESS_SPACE` |  The address space for the Azure TRE core virtual network. E.g. `10.1.0.0/22`. Recommended `/22` or larger.  |
| `TRE_ADDRESS_SPACE` | The address space for the whole TRE environment virtual network where workspaces networks will be created (can include the core network as well). E.g. `10.0.0.0/12`|
| `DEPLOY_GITEA` | If set to `false` disables deployment of the Gitea shared service. |
| `DEPLOY_NEXUS` | If set to `false` disables deployment of the Nexus shared service. |

### Deploy the TRE using the workflow

With all the repository secrets set, you can trigger a workflow run by pushing to develop/main of your fork, or by dispatching the workflow manually.
